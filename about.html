	        <h1 class="page-header">About Raffles Voices</h1>
	    	<p class="uk-text-large">Raffles Voices (Year 1-4) was founded in 1992 by Ms Charmaine Chiang. Since then, it has grown into a 80 Member strong SATB all-boys choir, which tackles a myriad of musical genres, ranging from Classical Works to Modern Compositions. It has since attained a high standard throughout the years.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large">Raffles Voices has participated in a wide range of choral competitions, ranging from the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging to overseas musical festivals. Recently in November 2010, Raffles Voices participated in the 27th International Franz Schubert Choir Competition in Vienna, emerging with a Gold award and Category Winner in the Mixed Youth category as well as a second Gold award and Category runner-up in the Sacred category whilst competing against many other adult choirs.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large">Apart from our rehearsals, Raffles Voices also organizes various camps and exchanges with choirs locally and internationally. To allow each singer to further his exploration in music, there are various small group student bodies under our choir, where singers showcase their talents in song writing, composition and also discover varied genres of music.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large">To date, Raffles Voices has toured the Netherlands, Finland, Austria, Germany, Spain, Hawaii, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. In the many years to come, Raffles Voices will be continually organizing overseas trips, various camps, showcase platforms and many other programmes to develop each member holistically while furthering their achievements both in Singapore and beyond.</p>
